# Utility Modules

This directory contains utility modules for backend/server-side operations.

## Files

- `schedule-parser.ts` - CSV and Excel schedule file parsing utilities

## Note

The `lib/utils.ts` file (at the parent level) contains the `cn()` helper function for class merging (Shadcn/UI utility). This is separate from the utility modules in this directory.
